## The Project

The tasks have been carried out using the .R file "Script.R"
Paths used in the "Script.R" file have been set relatively to the file location, so results and analysis can be reproduced easily.


Results can be found in the "results" folder.

### Results

The folder contains the following files:

- "P_wheat_Mt.tif": GeoTIFF file for the global production of wheat (in million tonnes)
- "N_yield_kg_ha.tif": GeoTIFF file for the global N<sub>Yield</sub> for wheat (in kg/ha)

- "Plot_N_10Countries.png": PNG file where the input, output and lossess of N have been plotted for the 10 principal wheat producer countries
- "Plot_N_yield_kg_ha.png": PNG file representing the global N<sub>Yield</sub> for wheat (in kg/ha)

- "N_10Countries.csv": csv table  reporting the NUE, input, output and loss of N for the 10 principal wheat producer countries
- "P_wheat_Countries.cvs": csv table reporting the total wheat production per country (in Mt)

- "Report.docx": doc file reporting the response to 4c), 5) and 6) questions:
